Today marks the 35th anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen
massacre. Numerous questions about what happened on that day still
persist. But 35 years later, the only emotion it evokes in me is
nostalgia. I reminisce about a young man, just 17 years old then. The
fact that he was on the streets protesting carries no
significance. What stirs in me is his youth. Every year, the world
commerates the event, and each time, it brings a visualization of my
17-year-old self, and it whispers to me, "you were so young then."

I'm in San Francisco today. The city's landscape is beautifully framed
from my room in the Hilton Union Square, with a distant waterfront
view. I spent the day at the office for the Carrot AI jam, but I can't
shake off the feeling of life slipping away unexploited. Li Tan shared
his idea for a startup company with me. I can't tell it's a good idea
or not, but I see clearly it's an example of not wasting one's life.

We sent off Ruru to NYC today, with her goose and longboard. Feeling
happy for her to spend 10 weeks in NYC with a nice company. Not sure
how much she can learn over there. Also, the relationship with Fellows
Fund is worrisome.

The family watched a film titled "Nowhere Special" in our living
room. The movie, whilst heart-wrenching, depicts the tale of a single
father who, diagnosed with cancer, is compelled to put his son up for
adoption. Despite interviewing multiple prospective families, he
selects a single mother who lost her own baby at a young age and can
no longer conceive. While I didn't verify, it seemingly presents as a
low-budget production. Nonetheless, the tangible struggle, profound
love, and palpable helplessness conveyed in the movie resonated as
remarkably authentic.

Additionally, Ruru is departing for NYC the next day. It will be some
time before we can indulge in a movie night. There's a touch of
melancholy associated with this, but perhaps the movie brought some
relief. After all, it serves as a reminder that there are, indeed,
greater sorrows in life.

I attended a Zoom meeting with Carlo's students to commemorate his
80th birthdayâ€”a full decade after we celebrated his 70th birthday at
UCLA.

Despite repeated comments noting little change in him, it's clear to
me that he has indeed aged. I perceived a potential desire in him to
address these comments, perhaps to mention his health concerns, but he
chose not to. Aging is a very sad aspect of life, and I cannot help
but imagine the much worse situation of myself in 30 years, should I
still be here.

The thought of visiting him in LA has crossed my mind, however, my
desire to do so is not particularly strong. Fundamentally, I'm not
very close to him, but it might be my issue. I am not close to
anybody.

The day was unexpectedly sunny following persistent gloomy weather. I
had reserved a table for three at Le Grand Bistro American for 7:30pm,
anticipating a sunset view. However, we were seated indoors by the
waiter. None of us complained because of the lingering outdoor
chilliness.  The food was satisfactory but not impressive. After
dinner, we took a brief stroll by the water, during which, Ruru
amusingly pretended to play piano on a covered Yamaha-branded boat.

** Discussion w/ Sierra (https://sierra.ai/)

- Clay Bavor (co-founder)
- elevate your customer experience w/ a trusted conversational ai platform
- fundamentally transform business
- customer service
- very complex reasoning
- sonar reasoning?
- hired princeton professor who worked on REACT paper
- 70% customer increase, CSAT increase
- devised a programming language to compose skills
  dial determinism to 10??
- headless API?
- AI agents represent a new type of software
- Step 1: RAG - "how can i add an item to an existing order?" (no training/fine-tuning models), low ceiling
- more complex knowledge base -> multiple articles, Sonas??? working memory
- Step 2: "I am missing something from my last order" -> i did not get the blueberries
- business logic??

you mentioned a programming language to compose skills ... how to compose? natural language? how much customization

** Oracle
I had a chat with Jun Qian of Oracle for 2.5 hours at a Panera place
in Factoria. Dan Roth has joined, which complicates things, and they
have a few other candidates. Overall, not clear if it's a good choice,
but just like many other choices, it's hard to tell.

** Trip & Clarice
I'm still bothered with the American Airline ticket situation - we
have over $13,000 credit with AA but seems can only be used to book AA
tickets to UK. I'm also not sure if Clarice made the right choice
about her internship, i.e., whether she should've stayed with UIUC to
learn the hardcore of ML instead of going to Celonois where she
probably won't learn much in the summer. Yongjian said I'm
overthinking, which could be true.

** Oppenheimer

The family watched "Oppenheimer" in the living room - an impressive
film. It provoked several thoughts. Firstly, it displayed how people
worked on significant projects, although they were used for
destructive purposes. This leads to a question: what are the most
meaningful projects to work on today? Could it be AI in science? What
could be my contribution in this field? Secondly, it showed that
technology is never primary; the driving force is always business,
politics, or products.

** ACM Fellow App

I wrote a 750 word draft. Still waiting for David Lomet and Phil
Bernstein's endorsements.

** VAE
I have been continually pondering this simple formula

\[ P(X) = \int P(X|z; \theta) P(z) dz\]

in the setting of variational autoencoder (VAE).

Here we have

$P(X|z;\theta)  = \mathcal{N}(X|f(z, \theta), \delta^2 * I)$

I've decided to begin keeping a diary, the purpose of which, I
believe, is to remain candid with myself. This notion partly came from
a post I saw on LinkedIn or Twitter. It seems worth reflecting upon daily.

Today, I accomplished several tasks:

a) I requested endorsements from four individuals for my ACM Fellow
application, an issue I've too long delayed. As of now, I've received
responses from Jiawei and Beng Chin.

b) Had a conversation with Alon about my decision regarding HKUST and
my ACM Fellow application. He is truly kind-hearted, and I need to
consider an appropriate way to express my gratitude.

c) I started on my ACM application and began documenting my
contributions, but progress has been slow due to my lack of focus.

Additionally, I spent the morning with my family visiting the Issaquah
Farmer's Market and Costco. We also stopped by to see the local
attraction known as "Jakob Two Trees, Issaquah's Troll." Clarice had
already been there on her longboard, so she was our guide. We took a
few pictures - it was a trip worth making.

We also had a conversation about Clarice's reading habits. Her
literary skills don't match mine, which is somewhat disheartening.

Unfortunately, I'm still dealing with a lingering cough and a runny
nose, hindering my full recovery.
