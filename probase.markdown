## A Data Driven Semantic Network for Text Understanding

Probase is a data driven semantic network that consists of millions of fine-grained concepts and their relationships. One of the goal of Probase is to enable generalization in natural language processing. One important application we have built using Probase is short text analysis (a.k.a. deep query understanding). Using the knowledge in Probase, we perform segmentation, build dependency tree, and annotate terms in a short text. This enables us to understand the intent of keyword based queries.

Below is a comprehensive list of Probase related publications.
