**VP Engineering, Algorithms & Distinguished Scientist @ Instacart**

I lead [the Aglorithms
team](https://tech.instacart.com/a-small-engineering-team-with-a-big-impact-40184c40d7e)
that focuses on using machine learning for e-commerce and fulfillment
at [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com). Previously, I led the
Research & Applied Science organization at WeWork, working on NLP,
computer vision, robotics, data management, sensor networks,
ubiquitous computing, etc. In my previous jobs, I worked on machine
learning and text understanding. My team built large-scale NLP
pipelines for short text and document understanding, and we developed
data-driven semantic networks to enable text understanding.
